# Simple-Multithreaded-TCP-GUI-Chat

Simple-Multithreaded-Network-Chat is a small simple chat appliction written in C# .net that is easy to understand and anyone can build on or learn from as it is not intended to be used for non development purposes.

I used vissual studio 2015 comunity to code and compile this project.

The server and client is multithreaded and uses sockets and TCP protocol to comunicate. It sends string arrays as packets. The first entry in the array is the name of the client and the second is the message.
